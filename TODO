Add rate limiter to gradio-side of the app.


Note: For Gradio apps in which queueing is enabled, users can bypass the queue if they make a POST request to your API endpoint. To disable this behavior, set api_open=False in the queue() method. To disable 
the API page altogether, set show_api=False in .launch().
