# Introduction

Pruju AI is a teaching assistant that allows students to interact with the teacher's course materials. The assistant is designed to answer any student question, but _only if_ the answer can be found in the course materials provided by the teacher (e.g., syllabus, slides, lecture transcripts). The assistant can also be guided to answer in ways that align with the courseâ€™s pedagogical objectives. For example, the assistant can be told to _not_ answer certain questions or to answer in a particular way.

The project exists to make creating virtual teaching assistants as easy as possible. From a pedagogical point of view, it is essential to be able to control the knowledge base of the assistant as well as the types of answers that the assistant provides to the student's questions.

The app can be configured to work with the teacher's own materials without any coding. You do need to modify some text files and run one Python script to make it your own. You can also use the code as a starting point for more sophisticated and customized setups. In the grander scheme of things, the project hopes to inspire the development of an open-source software ecosystem around AI in higher education.

The app works with OpenAI's API and Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service. The app also provides rudimentary support for Ollama. Ollama supports a wider range of open-source models (e.g., Mistral 7B, Llama 2).

# Getting started

The instructions are for macOS but should work with Linux and (with small modifications) Windows, too.

Clone the repo, create a virtual environment, and install required dependencies.

```bash
(.venv) foo@bar ~$: pip install -r requirements
```

## Create and edit .env

You should create a .env file that contains at least the following:

```
# Directory for your course data:
CHAT_DATA_FOLDER ="coursegpt_resources" 
# How many times the default model can be called before a fallback model is used
# For (Azure) OpenAI: default is gpt-4, fallback is gpt-3.5
DEFAULT_MODEL_QUOTA=3
# Total call quota (default + fallback)
TOTAL_MODEL_QUOTA=5
MAX_PROMPT_TOKENS=2000
# Capacity management:
MAX_CONCURRENCY=2
MAX_QUEUE=10
```

## LLM-provider specific environment variables

You can currently choose between "azure" (Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service), "openai" (OpenAI's own API), or "ollama" (Ollama).

If you choose azure, you must define the API endpoint and API key:

```
LLM_PROVIDER="azure"
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY = "your-secret-key-goes-here" 
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-azure-endpoint"
```

If you choose openai, you must define the API key:

```
LLM_PROVIDER="openai"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-secret-key-goes-here" # Use this if you use non-Azure OpenAI 
```

If you choose ollama, you need to define the model to be used.

```
LLM_PROVIDER="ollama"
OLLAMA_MODEL_NAME="mistral"
```

In the case of Ollama, you need to  install Ollama and run `ollama serve <modelname>` to serve the model to `127.0.0.1:11434`. Only Mistral 7B has been tested so far. The basic functionality works, but it's not implemented to the same standard as Azure OpenAI API and OpenAI API.

# Launch the app

Run:

```bash
(.venv) foo@bar ~$: gradio app.py
```

Once the app is running, it will tell you the address where you can find the chatbot interface.

# Course materials

The variable `CHAT_DATA_FOLDER` in the .env file tells the app where to look for the course materials. It is basically a bunch of text files, markdown documents, pictures, and - most importantly - a vector store that contains the teaching materials.

Everything else can be set up simply by editing text/markdown files and moving some files around. However, to read your own materials to a vector store, you should run:

```bash
(.venv) foo@bar ~$: python3 read_to_vectorstore.py
```

The script will read your course materials from a given location (`./course_material` by defaul) and store them to a [FAISS](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/faiss) vector store (by default `./course_material_vdb`). Once you are done, move the `index.faiss` and `index.pkl` files to `$CHAT_DATA_FOLDER/faiss_index`.

# Prompt engineering

The chatbot reads general system instructions from `prompt_template.txt` in the `CHAT_DATA_FOLDER` directory. Edit the instructions to get desired assistant behavior.

# Required custom configurations files

There are a bunch of other things you need to configure in your custom data folder before it works. As a starting point, you can just copy the files from the default folder.

- `favicon.ico` is the icon of the app.
- `chat_header.md` provides a modifiable description of your app that is displayed above the chat interface.
- `chat_footer.md` as above, but below the chat interface.
- `examples_ui.txt` defines the examples that help the user start asking useful questions.

# Project status

The project is currently in a working demo state, with lots of room for improvement. Some possible directions for further development: 

- _New features_: For example, alternative assistance modes (e.g., simple Q&A, prepping for exam, reflective discussions) coudl be useful.
- _Technical improvements_: For example, the app has not been optimized for large use volumes.
- _Support for alternative LLMs_: The app was originally designed to run with OpenAI's ChatGPT, but because the app uses lanchain to make the API calls, it can be integrated with many other LLMs with relative ease.
